### Introduction

This first project is one you may see again in your future. Many times coding interviews will use this to test your coding skills.  We will be writing a [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) program. If you've never heard of FizzBuzz it's quite simple. We'll start counting up to 15. When the number is divisible by 3, we'll shout "FIZZ!". If the number is divisible by 5, we'll shout "BUZZ" and if the number is divisible by both 3 AND 5, we'll shout "FIZZBUZZ!". If the number is neither divisible by 3 or 5, we'll simply print out that number.

#### Assignment

1. If you haven't already, create a new git repository and create a new python file. You can name it whatever you'd like.
2. Think through the problem. Take it one step at a time. This is the basic skill of programming.
    * Write a program to count to 15
    * Check if the current number is divisible by 3. If so, print "FIZZ"
    * Check if the current number is divisibile by 5. If so, print "BUZZ"
    * Check if the current number is divisible by 3 AND 5. If so, print "FIZZUBZZ"
    * Otherwise, print the number.
3. **Hard Mode**: Turn your code into a function. Be able to pass a `max_number` argument to count beyond 15.
