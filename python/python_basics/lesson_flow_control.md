Printing a simple string to the console is great, but doesn't solve many problems. What happens if you want to make a comparison of two objects? To dig deeper into programming we're going to learn about flow control.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, you should be able to do the following:

* Know the various boolean operators
* Understand how 

### Introduction

Flow control is the simple concept of running different parts of code based on a comparison.  Here's an example in [pseudocode](https://www.google.com/search?q=pseudocode):

~~~python
if my height is less than 48 inches:
    print "You are too short to ride this rollercoaster"
otherwise:
    print "Welcome aboard"
~~~

The same can be done in python. We can make simple comparisons to control the "flow" of a program. The same pseudocode can be written in python as:

~~~python
if my_height < 48:
    print("You are too short for this rollercoaster")
else:
    print("Welcome aboard")
~~~

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Read [Chapter 2](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter2/) of _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ to learn about flow control and boolean operators (Don't worry if you don't know what these are yet!)

</div>

### Knowledge Check

* There are 6 comparison operators, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`
* The (double-)equals comparison operator is not the same as a variable assignment operator (can also be said as: `== != =` )
* Use if/else statements to control the flow of a program. 
* Use loops or while statements if you need to repeat an action. Both have their own use cases.

### Exercises

* Brush up on the previous lesson by running through [these String Formatting](https://www.learnpython.org/en/String_Formatting) examples. Do your best to determine the before clicking "run."
* Run through the [Conditions Exercise](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions). Some of this may be new material
