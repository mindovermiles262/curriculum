### Introduction

In the following few lessons you'll be getting into the nitty-gritty stuff of programming. We've already installed python, your code editor, and you should know the basics of moving around in the terminal. Take a deep breath, grab a glass of water, and let's get started!

There is going to be a lot of reading in these first few lessons. It's important that you know and understand these basic concepts - data types, data structures, and loops. We've broken them up into small bites to better digest them. Watch the videos in the additional resources to solidify the concepts you read about. Above all "practice practice practice!" Code along with the tutorials. Code along with the videos. If you get stuck reach out to our online communities in the forums or in the chat.
