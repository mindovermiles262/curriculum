### Introduction

One of the best things about computers is their ability to perform repetative tasks quickly and without errors. We'll use some [Project Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler) challenges to test your coding skills so far.

#### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Take a look at [challenge 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) of Project Euler. Find the sum of the multipes of 3 or 5 below 1,000. Don't worry if your code isn't the most elegant solution. **HINT**: You should get a sum of 233,168

2. Take a crack at [challenge 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) of Project Euler. Again, don't worry if your code isn't perfect. As long as you get the correct answer you're doing great. **HINT**: You should get a sum of 4,613,732
